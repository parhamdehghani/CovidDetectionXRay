Detecting Covid cases by analyzing the X-ray images of the lungs - by training densenet-201 pre-trained model in pytorch
I have used Kaggle jnegrini/covid-19-radiography-data-eda-and-cnn-model dataset for the training, and testing is done with the test set of the dataset and some other images I found over the net.
